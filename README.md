# Kortlaegning
Kortlaegning ("Mapping" in Danish) or "Kort" ("Map") for short, is a project to functionality for enumerating resources in an Azure DevOps environment (i.e., Organization(s) or Project(s)), then creating graphs of the resources and their relationships.

The goal is to establish a consistent interface for graphing modules to consume the structure of the target environment. These modules can then use their chosen graphing solution to render the graph.
